    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to
      be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content.
      It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render
      the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
      originally included cues for its appearance.

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and
      styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such
      as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
      and JavaScript.[2]
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
      including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility;
      [further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
      characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
      .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file
      to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
      and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript
      on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]
    </p>
    <p>
      Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.
      These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps.
      The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
